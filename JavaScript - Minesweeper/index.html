<h2>Description</h2>
Minesweeper is a single player puzzle game. The objective is to choose tiles on square board and clear the board.
<br />The board also contains hidden mines which detonate if they are chosen.
<br />If a tile is chosen that is not a mine, it either reveals the number (but not position) of mines around it or,
<br />if there are no mines, reveals all tiles around it.

<h2>Preliminary Software Design</h2>
<h3>Global Variables:</h3>
<ul>
<li>NumMines (int)</li>
<li>NumSquares (int)</li>
<li>gameWin (int)</li>
</ul>Initialized at game start, NumMines decreases when a mine is flagged and NumSquares decreases when a square is clicked. Neither decrease if a non-mine is flagged.
<br />Victory is achieved when both of the variables reach zero, in which case gameWin is set to 1.
<br /><h3>Tiles:</h3>
<b>{"mine": false, "revealed": false, "flagged": false, "count": 0}</b>
<br />When a tile is clicked it either ends the game (if isMine is true), reveals its number (if >0), or reveals nearby tiles (if number=0). It does nothing if the tile is flagged.
<br /><h3>The Grid</h3>
<b>{ {tile, tile, tile...}, {tile, tile, tile...}, {tile, tile, tile...} ...}</b>
<br />A 2-dimensional array of tile objects. The outer array is the x-coord, the inner array is the y-coord (grid[x][y]).
<br /><h3>Board Setup:</h3>
Tiles are initialized as 0,false. A number of random mines are generated. When each mine is placed, it increments the counter of each surrounding tile and sets its current tile to true.
<br />If a mine would be placed on an existing mine, it skips that tile and tries again up to 10 times. If it fails to place a mine 10 times, it stops adding mines.
<br /><h3>Internal Functions</h3>
<b>setMine(x,y)</b> - attempts to set 'mine' in a tile to true. Returns false if the tile is already a mine.
<br /><b>checkVictory()</b> - Simply checks to see if numMines and numTiles are both 0. If they are, sets the gameWin to 1.
<br /><h3>External Functions</h3>
<b>revealTile(x,y)</b> - reveals a tile. If the tile is a mine, it sets the gameWin to -1 and returns the MINE constant. If the tile is a 0, it also reveals tiles in the four cardinal directions around the first.
<br /><b>drawTile(x,y)</b> - Returns the value of a tile. A constant for tiles that haven't been revealed yet, constants for mines and flags, or the count of nearby mines.
<br /><b>flag(x,y)</b> - Flags or unflags a tile. Decrements the numMines counter if the tile being flagged is a mine, and calls checkVictory.
