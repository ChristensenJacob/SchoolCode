<h2>Project Documentation: Minesweeper</h2>
<p><h3>Documentation explaining how you implemented your game and how it satisfies the remainder of the requirements. The documentation should be in a file named documentation.html, with a link to the documentation file on the project description page.</h3>
<b>The program generates a different mine configuration for each game.</b>
<br />When the player presses <i>generate</i> a grid is created with either the default options or options entered in the input boxes.
After the grid is created, a random number of tiles are set as mines.
<br /><b>The player can flag squares in the grid as mines, and can also change a square back to being unflagged.</b>
<br />Toggling the <i>flagging</i> option at the bottom of the page allows a player to flag and unflag tiles
<br /><b>The program tells how many mines are in the grid and displays the number of mines that have been flagged at any given time.</b>
<br />Displays above the grid show how many mines are present and how many flags the player has placed. It does NOT show how many flags are correctly placed,
because that would allow cheating.
<br /><b>If a zero square is clicked, all adjacent zero squares (recursively) are also revealed. All non-zero squares adjacent to the revealed zero squares are also revealed.</b>
<br />When a zero tile is revealed, it recursively calls the revealing function on all adjacent tiles. This repeats until all connected zero tiles, and their numbered border tiles,
are revealed.
<br /><b>The player can choose the size of the puzzle and the number of mines.</b>
<br />Input boxes are available at the top of the grid that allow the player to customize the game. If too many mines are entered, the game attempts to place as many as it can
until it fails (attempts to place a mine on an existing mine) ten times. This means that completely filling up the grid is unlikely, as the mine placing code will fail before it 
selects every tile. The mine display is accurate to the number of mines actually placed in the grid.
<br /><b>The program displays a message when the game is over (a mine is clicked, or all non-mine squares have been revealed and all mine squares are correctly flagged).</b>
<br />When an end condition is reached (either all tiles are clicked and all mines are flagged, or a mine is clicked) the grid becomes unclickable and a victory/defeat 
message appears above the grid</p>
<p><h3>Game grid that uses CSS and is generated by JavaScript</h3>
Grid is generated by JavaScript, all css is managed in an external file: "main.css"</p>
<p><h3>User input in the form of text, select options, and/or buttons</h3>
Text and Buttons are available on the grid page</p>
<p><h3>User input in the form of mouse clicks</h3>
The game is played primarily through mouse clicks</p>
<p><h3>Dynamic modification of HTML using innerHTML or DOM functions</h3>
Results of game interaction are displayed by changing the game grid through functions that manage innerHTML</p>
<p><h3>Use of XMLHttpRequest to load JSON or XML game data that is displayed on the grid page</h3>
I couldn't think of a valid use for this in the game (reading/writing to files is bad practice in javascript and I don't have a server to test with), so I instead reused part of
assignment 6 that loads data from the disk when the 'XMLHTTP' button is pressed</p>
<p><h3>Incorporates HTML 5 audio tags, video tags, canvas, or local storage </h3>
Game saving and loading is used through HTML5 local storage</p>
<p><h3>Game logic code </h3>
Game is <b>fully functional and playable</b>, enjoy!</p>
<p><h3>Other Comments</h3>
I did some work with getting the grid to show up properly with higher dimensions, the div now grows in width if the grid becomes too big. This means that scrollbars appear if it gets too large,
but the tiles stay the same size. I feel the need to scroll on oversized grids is an acceptable tradeoff for tile size consistency. On an unrelated note, generating the max grid size and clicking
a zero tile reveals a cave-like structure, I could probably use this in another game as a map generating function.</p>
